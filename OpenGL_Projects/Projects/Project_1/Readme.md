# Project 1: Flat Shading 

## Description

This project uses .obj file with only vertex and face position data. The project uses the geometric shader to calculate normals and uses phong lighting.
For this project, I used the bunny.obj and the dragon.obj file which can be found in the resources/models folders.
Additionally, the project include a movable camera that can be controller using the keyboard.
