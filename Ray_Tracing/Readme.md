# Ray Tracing Program

This Ray Tracing Program is a compilation of different small assignments for my class in computer graphics at NYU during the Fall 2020.
In this project, I will implement a basic raytracer and use it to render spheres, planes, and meshes with different projections (Orthographic or Perspective), different shading displays and .

### Preparing the Environment and Submission

Follow the instructions on the [general instructions page](../RULES.md) to set up what you need to run this project locally.

### Using Eigen

Please  note that I used the external math library eigen to do all math calculations. Please see below a Getting Started](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html) page for a reference of the basic matrix operations supported.
